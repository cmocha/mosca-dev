Hi I'm Chris. I have been designing and coding websites for roughly over 10 years. I have worked mostly with building client facing front ends in popular CMS like WordPress, Joomla and Drupal. I still work with some of these today on a regular basis. Recently I have been exploring some newer alternatives to those old dogs like headless CMS's, the Jamstack, various generators like Gatsby or 11ty (this site is built with 11ty).

I'm excited where the web is going and this shift in tech and available services has certainly re-ignited passions for me with building for the web in new ways. When I'm not building websites for clients, in my free time in between hanging with friends and family I'm always messing with something tech on a personal project that I can get away with trying things out on. If you need help with your web project give me a shout.

So besides a spot for me to talk about myself and work, this blog is my personal field notes of technical things done past. Just really a collection of references to help me remember and hopefully help others on their journeys just as others have guided me on my journey. So if you like what you find here please share it. Thank you for reading! Peace!!! ;)
