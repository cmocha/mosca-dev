Hi I'm Chris. "web slinger guy..." or more formally "Web Developer". I have been designing and coding websites for roughly over 10 years. I have worked mostly with building client facing front ends and interfaces in popular CMS like WordPress, Joomla and Drupal. Yep, I still work with some of these today on a regular basis.

On the other side of things, I have recently been exploring some newer alternatives like headless CMS's, generators like Gatsby or 11ty (this site is built with 11ty). I have been reading about JAMstack and best practices and looking to perhaps leverge on some future projects. I'm always messing with the latest tools of the trade on personal or small projects that I can get away with trying things out on. I'm excited where the web is going and this recent trend has certainly re-ignited passions for me with building for the web in new ways. 

Well besides a spot for me to talk about myself and show off some work time to time, this blog is my personal field notes of technical things done past. Just really a collection of references to help me remember. I hope that I can help others on their journeys just as others have guided me on my journey. So if you like what you find here please share it. Cheers!!! ;)
