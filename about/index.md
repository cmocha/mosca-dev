I have been designing and coding websites for roughly over 10 years. I have worked mostly with building client facing front ends in popular CMS like WordPress, Joomla and Drupal. I still work with some of these today on a regular basis. Recently working with headless CMS's, the Jamstack, various generators like Gatsby or 11ty (this site is built with 11ty).

If you need help with your web project give me a shout.

This is my personal field notes of technical things done past. A collection of references to refer back to. Maybe help others on their journeys just as others have guided me on my journey. If you like what you find here please share it. -0316 ABBA
